# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025. I'll mainly be using Python here, with maybe a dash of C added in.

## Structure

There is a directory for each day named day_1 to day_12. Each one will contain an `input.txt` file and 2 files `day_x_p1` and `day_x_p2` for each part.

## Progress

- [x] Day 1: Secret Entrance
- [x] Day 2: Gift Shop
- [x] Day 3: Lobby
